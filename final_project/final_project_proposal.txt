I would like to do something as part of my rotation in a lab that does a lot of mass spectrometry proteomics. In proteomics, when comparing protein abundance across samples a major issue is how to deal with proteins which were not detected in all samples. Due to the randomness of detection in mass spectrometry, it's not always appropriate to set them to 0, so there are different ways these missing values are imputed to allow statistical comparisons. For my project, I will take the same raw dataset analyzed with three different imputation methods to see how this affects things like the variability of data, normalization, and ability to detect differentially-expressed proteins. My learning goals are mostly 1) getting better at doing complex manipulations of large dataframes and 2) learning how to make good-looking plots beyond basic scatterplots and histograms.
